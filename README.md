## About me
I'am Hardware and Software developer since my childhood
I started with Basic programming on ZX-Spectrum and with The 7400 series of transistorâ€“transistor logic (TTL).
### The 7400 series contains hundreds of devices that provide everything from basic logic gates, flip-flops, and counters, to special purpose bus transceivers and arithmetic logic units (ALU).

### ZX Spectrum, the Commodore 64, Dragon 32, Oric-1, Oric Atmos, BBC Micro and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s.
