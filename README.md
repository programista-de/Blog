## IDEA'S
My ideas are (still) living in the broad spectrum, from software to hardware.
last 10 years I decided to focus in software.
That's why i am really interested to support project and community in DevOps World.

## How i am working on my projects
Generally is better to make small part of code which is working, than big project which is in 99% 'done'.
So, i decided to make my projects small as is possible, because of time and engagement.
