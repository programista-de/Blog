Static Blog based on *.md files, about my ideas, code and todo-list

## About me
I'am Hardware and Software developer since my childhood
I started with Basic programming on ZX-Spectrum and with The 7400 series of transistorâ€“transistor logic (TTL).

### The 7400 series
contains hundreds of devices that provide everything from basic logic gates, flip-flops, and counters, to special purpose bus transceivers and arithmetic logic units (ALU).

### ZX Spectrum
The Commodore 64, Dragon 32, Oric-1, Oric Atmos, BBC Micro and later the Amstrad CPC range were rivals to the Spectrum in the UK market during the early 1980s.

## IDEA'S
My ideas are (still) living in the broad spectrum, from software to hardware.
last 10 years I decided to focus in software.
That's why i am really interested to support project and community in DevOps World.

## How i am working on my projects
Generally is better to make small part of code which is working, than big project which is in 99% 'done'.
So, i decided to make my projects small as is possible, because of time and engagement.


## What I know in practice
Languages: 
PHP, Js, NodeJs, ...

## WHAT I would like to know (in practice)
* Ansible,
* Openshift

## What I would like to learn better
* ID scanning, OCR, OpenCV 

## TODO LIST 2018
* OpenShift on Contabo Server
* Apicra
* DeOpsTerminal
